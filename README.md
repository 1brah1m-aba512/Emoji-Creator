# Emoji-Creator
This C++ program demonstrates object-oriented programming by designing an emoticon using shapes. The project includes constructors and destructors to manage objects, providing a practical introduction to class design.

## Features
- Implements `Emoticon` class with no-args, parameterized, and copy constructors.
- Generates an emoticon using basic shapes.
- Demonstrates information hiding and encapsulation.

## Requirements
- A suitable .ppm file viewer such as gimp is stringly advised to be used to see the image clearly

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EmojiCreator.git`
2. Navigate to the directory: `cd EmojiCreator`
3. Compile the program: `g++ *.cpp -o EmojiCreator`
4. Convert to PPM : `EmojiCreator -> Emoji.ppm` 
5. Run the program: `./Emoji.ppm`

## Future Improvements
- Add color options for the emoticon.
- Enable users to customize shape and design.
